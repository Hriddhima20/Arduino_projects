# ðŸš¦ Traffic Light Controller

This project simulates a **traffic light controller** using an **Arduino Uno**. It follows the standard red-yellow-green light sequence to manage traffic at an intersection.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Simulates real-world traffic light operation ðŸš¥
- Uses **LEDs** to represent traffic signals
- Simple and efficient timing control
- Can be expanded for pedestrian crossing signals

## ðŸ”§ Components Required
| Quantity | Component |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Arduino Uno R3 |
| 1 | Red LED |
| 1 | Yellow LED |
| 1 | Green LED |
| 3 | 330Î© Resistor |
| 1 | Breadboard |
| Wires | Jumper Wires |

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions
1. **Connect LEDs** to Arduino as per the circuit diagram.
2. **Upload the code** to the Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Power on** and observe the traffic light sequence.
